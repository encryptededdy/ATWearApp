# WearTransit
Smartwatch App for NZ Public Transport, for showing real-time boards on your Android Wear 2.0 watch. Supports saving favourite stops and opening up to view more info on your phone. Has a map for locating stops near you.

Use the ![Waka API](https://github.com/consindo/waka) for data (as it's way faster than the AT API). There is an old AT API based implementation near the beginning of the project if you're looking into how to use that.
