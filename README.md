# WearTransit
Google Play beta testing: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nz.zhang.aucklandtransportwear

Smartwatch App for NZ Public Transport, for showing real-time boards on your Android Wear 2.0 watch. Supports saving favourite stops and opening up to view more info on your phone. Has a map for locating stops near you.

Ambient mode is supported for the stop timetable/realtime view with a clock.

Complications are also supported for adding shortcuts to your favourite stop on your watchface.

Uses the ![Waka API](https://github.com/consindo/waka) for data (as it's way faster than the AT API). There is an old AT API based implementation near the beginning of the project if you're looking into how to use that.
